Hey everyone, so here^^ is the tutorial that I've been going off by, when fiddling around with OpenCV.
I'll get my code that I've been experimenting with up by Sunday night-- comments and everything. (C++) 

As a group log we've got:

Amanda: Will run imellipse on half of image sequence E272K03A to find diameter of droplet. (Matlab)  

Willie: Will run on other half. (Matlab)

Rylan: Wrote initial script. (Matlab)
